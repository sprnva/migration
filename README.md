# database-migration

>Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your team to define and share the application's database schema definition. If you have ever had to tell a teammate to manually add a column to their local database schema after pulling in your changes from source control, you've faced the problem that database migrations solve.

# WHAT IS MIGRATION?
Migration is your database version control when collaborating with teams or for yourself. This will help you or your team to get the latest database update as possible. With a user interface, migration is easy to use. You can include this to any projects and start versioning your database development.

# CONFIGURATION
- update the config.php and set the connection to your database
- point your mysql_path to your mysql/bin folder
